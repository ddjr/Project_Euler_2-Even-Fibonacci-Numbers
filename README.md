# Project_Euler_6-Even-Fibonacci-Numbers

This Project was done as part of https://projecteuler.net/ problem sets. This code solves problem 2. The following discription is taken from https://projecteuler.net/problem=2:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

To run the project open your terminal, find the directory where this file is located, and type python even_fibonacci_numbers.py
